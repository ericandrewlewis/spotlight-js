# Spotlight.js

An overlay search component for your website similar to Spotlight on the Mac. 

It should pop-up on keyboard shortcuts similar to TinyMCE's accessors (maybe `control+alt+space` on a Mac).

It should let you search through every navigation item in the sitemap. 

How do search indices work to give you relevant results?
